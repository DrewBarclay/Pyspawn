A Pygame version of the Spawn Lite app.

To run this, you'll require Pygame. You can download it here: https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads

This was actually made in October 2009 back when I sucked at programming and before I knew how to make a proper project. I don't recall if it runs in Python 2 or Python 3. Good luck trying to get it running.
